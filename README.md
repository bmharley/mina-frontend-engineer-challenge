# Mina front-end coding challenge

ðŸ‘‹ Hello worthy challenger,

As the next stage of your interview process we'd like you to build us a simple SPA using typescript, SCSS and the Github REST API.

Using this repository as a base, we'd like you to send us a pull request with and an app that:

- Accepts a GitHub username
- Displays information about the user (if valid - if invalid show appropriate feedback) including a list of their public repositories
- Allows you to click a repository, navigating to a different route which displays the last 5 commits to that repo

We would like you to use:

- Typescript
- SCSS
- The Github REST API
- React Router
- Yarn

Apart from that, any library or technology choices are up to you.

Please commit all your work to a branch (not `main`) and send us a pull request

Happy coding ðŸ˜ƒ

## Things to note

- Browser support: modern browsers (i.e. no IE11)
- This repository uses prettier for code formatting and won't let you push unless it's formatted correctly. You can do this using the Prettier VS code extension with `formatOnSave` turned on - you can also run `yarn prettier:write` from the root
